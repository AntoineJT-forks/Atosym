- Multiplication doesn't work with powered expressions, such as x^3, because only "x" is identified
- Division has not been configured for variables, hence all expressions containing '/' and variables
  won't be reduced properly
- Pow encounters the same issue as division
- Some math shortcuts currently don't work, such as "9x*y" instead of "9x*1y". Same for "(3+2)x" instead of "(3+2)*1x"
